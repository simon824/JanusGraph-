## What is janusgraph-externals?

`janusgraph-externals` is an unofficial collection of external toolkits built around `janusgraph`. The purpose is to make `janusgraph` more convenient and efficient to use, including the following modules.  

- **janusgraph-graphx**  
`janusgraph-graphx` built on top of `Apache Spark GraphX` and `JanusGraph`. The purpose is to integrate these two components. Spark generates RDD by parsing the underlying HFile of JanusGraph and deserializing the JanusGraph vertex-edge structure. Welcome developers to test and upgrade iteratively together. (This is a basic version adapt to `janusgraph-0.5.2`, other versions need to be tested)
   
- **janusgraph-seatunnel**  
`janusgraph-seatunnel` built on top of `SeaTunnel`. The purpose is to improve the efficiency of batch import and export of JanusGraph data.(Coming soon)

> Stay tuned for more content! (For example: Spark writes into JanusGraph by generating HFile, visual query platform, etc. Developers are also welcome to contribute!)
